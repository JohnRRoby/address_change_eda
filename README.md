Quick exploration of USPS's change of address data

I learned from the [Data is Plural newsletter](https://www.data-is-plural.com/) that the U.S. Postal Service regularly releases numbers of Change of Address (COA) filings by ZIP code. [Here's the data.](https://about.usps.com/who/legal/foia/library.htm)

This is an exploratory data analysis of the USPS's Change of Address data. I suspect if ZIP codes can be ranked by net change, then combining apartment rental data would give insight into how moves could affect renters' budgets.
